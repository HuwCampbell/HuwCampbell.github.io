        <h1>Resume</h1>

        <p>Dedicated software engineer, machine learning expert, data scientist,
and physicist, looking to enjoy cutting edge research, development
and analytics. Strong interpersonal and communication skills,
combined with broad research experience and creative thinking,
present a well rounded professional.</p>
<h2 id="software-engineering-and-data-science">Software Engineering and Data Science</h2>
<p>Currently working for a machine learning and data science start-up
specialising in massive scale feature engineering and model development
with deep customer integrations. I have been responsible for pipeline
construction, customer analytics, and model building; and have built
systems catering to millions of customers in varied business spaces.
Some of my interests in this space are deep learning, infrastructure
development, model optimisation, and creative experimental designs.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-research">Scientific Research</h2>
<p>My research encompassed looking at the ways one can use quantum
mechanics to understand physical systems, and how quantum properties
can be used to develop novel technology. I have broad expertise in
theoretical and experimental physics, and the drive to put both of
these skill sets to use in solving novel problems.</p>
<p>My Ph.D involved using scanning tunnelling microscopy to fabricate
nanoscale devices in solid state systems, with the longer term goal
of fabricating a scalable, solid state, quantum computer. My
theoretical extended from this, using quantum information theory
to investigate the physics and applications of quantum computation,
and data analysis to assess my experimental results. These experiences
provide a strong understanding of data analysis and mathematics,
as well as hands on ability and creative insight.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Principal Consultant</strong>, Simple Machines ( September 2018 – Present )</p>
<p>Simple Machines is a high end technology consulting firm, my role is
to assist in bringing forth scalable and robust machine learning and
data science for our clients.</p>
<p>With Simple Machines I have worked across a wide variety of projects
and disciplines, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anaml Feature Engineering Platform.<br>
I am the principal engineer for a feature engineering and analytics tool,
designed to help businesses collaborate more productively when performing
analytics or machine learning tasks. With a custom version control system
and governance workflow, and high performance Spark backend.</li>
<li>Big data streaming productionisation in Kafka and Spark.<br>
Reworked and advised a new Kafka architectures which would better
facilitate propagating cell tower data at rates higher than 200 gigabytes
per hour. Consumed and processed this data with a custom, high capacity
Spark streaming application.</li>
<li>Kafka streaming and Snowflake database solutions for a banking client</li>
<li>Education and Training</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Researcher / Data Scientist</strong>, Ambiata ( March 2014 – August 2018 )</p>
<p>Ambiata specialises in transforming massive scale data problems into
tractable machine learning solutions. Beginning when then company was
a start-up, my roles have included training models for clients,
constructing production pipelines catering for millions of customers,
programming language construction and EDSL design, machine learning
research, data analysis, ETL plumbing work and data integrity, client
management, and team education.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead data science for the <em>Best Industry Application of Data Analytics</em>
as judged by the Consensus Group.</li>
<li>Presentations for <em>The Data Warehouse Institute</em>, as well as functional
programming and technical meetups and conferences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-doctorate researcher</strong>, Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology</p>
<p>This position involved researching various theoretical models used to
describe low dimensional, solid state quantum systems. As part of this
I assisted writing review paper on how these models are applied and
their objective strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Software Development</strong>, Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology</p>
<p>I was responsible for the creation of software to communicate with a
Scanning Tunnelling Microscope control unit to implement an STM lithography
suite. Working in LabVIEW and C♯, I created software which drew from
my knowledge of the research group and their requirements, and was able
to implement features far exceeding what was previously available. The
task was completed with broad praise and on time.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Outreach Consultant</strong>, Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology</p>
<p>I advised the private production company Mod Productions as the scientific
expert and liaison for the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication
Technology. This was for the purposes of conceiving of, and scoping a
computer game based on quantum computer architectures to further the outreach
and research goals of the Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Research Assistant</strong>, University of New SouthWales Astronomy Department</p>
<p>I performed the reduction and analysis of quasar spectral data to assist
in a variation of constants project. Light from these bright, distant
objects passes through interstellar gas clouds and is absorbed at chemical
resonant frequencies. By analysing the shift in the frequencies absorbed at
different distances from the earth, one can determine if and how the
fundamental constants of the universe have changed over its lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Private Tutor</strong></p>
<p>Private tutoring in mathematics and physics from high school to undergraduate level.</p>
<p><strong>Live Homework Help</strong>.</p>
<p>Online tutoring in maths and sciences for high school students.</p>
