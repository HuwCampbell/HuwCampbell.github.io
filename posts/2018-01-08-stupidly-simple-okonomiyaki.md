I've been getting into cooking more Japanese food again recently.
Last night we had a great japanese-style ratatouille with grilled
steak, and tonight I tried my hand at a simple okonomiyaki. It
worked so well I thought I might share.

I will refine this recipe in future, so be prepared for minor
volumetric changes and additional spice additions.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 Zucchini
- 2 Small potatoes (one normal sized one would do)
- A handful of button mushrooms (or one large field mushroom)
- 100g Flour
- 3 Eggs

Optional garnishes

- Spring onion
- Chopped up bacon

For the sauce

- 50 ml of Mayonnaise
- 1/2 tsp of Soy sauce
- (Optional) 1/2 tsp Miso paste

Method
------

Grate the zucchini, potato, and mushrooms (yes, the mushrooms too)
into a bowl. Add two (2) of the eggs and stir.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour and the remaining egg, with
about 50-100ml of cold water, and whisk to a thin batter.

Mix the batter through the zucchini mixture well.

You're now ready to cook. In a big skillet, head some oil to a medium
heat. Grab a handful of the mixture and place it in the pan, press it
down with an eggslice, it should be around 1cm thick and 10cm in
diameter. Cook in batches, fitting as many separate pancakes as you
can in your pan.

If you're using bacon or spring onions, just sprinkle them on the top
of your pancakes before you turn them.

After about 5 minutes, they should be a nice golden colour on the bottom,
when they are, flip them over for another 5 minutes, making sure they're
cooked all the way through.

Mix the sauce ingredients thoroughly, and add generously apply to the
to the top of pancake before serving.
